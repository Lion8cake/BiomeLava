  Welcome to Biome Colored Lava!
-===============================-

This mod adds in styles to lava to make lava look different in different biomes similar to how water has its own water styles.

When going into a biome the lava will smoothly transition into a new lava style. These lava styles both look and act differently to the normal purity lava.

Has support for Retro and Trippy lighting
Has Capture support - ingame screenshot ui (does anyone actually use it?)

When going into a new biome the lava style will change the lava's:
* Texture
* Lavafall
* Light color
* Splash dust
* Droplet gore
* And debuffs (can be turned off via config)

Lava styles not only can be changed by lava but also be changed by waterfountains too for decoration purposes.

Lavastyles added by this mod:
* Purity (normal)
* Corruption
* Crimson
* Hallow
* Jungle
* Snow
* Desert

For Developers:

This mod also has incredible mod support both with Strong Reference and also by ModCalls.

This mod now uses the ModLiquid Library mod to handle edits to liquids much better.
